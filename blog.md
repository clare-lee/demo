## About Me
Hello, my name is Clare. I'm currently in LA and rocking a tan only on my feet. 
I enjoy skin care and cooking in my free time. I'm most comfortable with Python
and SQL. I would like to get more familiar with javascript, so I'm really excidted
to do this Severless Camp. Unfortunately I just finished up moving this week, so 
we'll see how far I get in this first week or if I finish at all.

Cheers!
